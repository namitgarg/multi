  This is the default layout template for nice menus, and will provide
  a starting point for the look of your menus. To customize, it's
  recommended to create a custom CSS file using this file as a template,
  then configure the module to use your custom CSS file
  (this is done in the global settings tab of the theme administration.)

  See README.txt and the handbook page (http://drupal.org/node/185543)
  for more information on using the CSS.
